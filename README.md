# Hybrid Dashboard

A comprehensive sample demonstrating cross-platform dashboard development using .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid technology. Build once and deploy to native mobile apps (iOS, Android, macOS), desktop (Windows), and web using shared Razor components and a unified codebase.

## Overview

**Hybrid Dashboard** demonstrates how to build a sophisticated business dashboard that runs on multiple platforms using .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid. The application features interactive charts, data grids, and summary cards—all powered by Syncfusion components and shared across platforms through a Razor Class Library.
- **Shared UI Components**: Razor Class Library (`HybridDashboard.Shared`) contains all dashboard UI components
- **Platform-Specific Services**: Dependency injection pattern for platform-specific implementations
- **Multi-target Support**: Single codebase targeting Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and web
- **Code Reuse**: Maximize code sharing across native and web targets

## Features
